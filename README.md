# GeneNameGenie
GeneNameGenie (GNG) is a Neo4j graph database which represents molecular identifiers as well as their relationships in a 
most flexible and visually approachable way. GNG can be used to convert human molecular identifiers 
among 47 different DBs, without requiring the provision of the source DB. For example, given the molecular 
identifier _Bcl-2_, GNG can retrieve the current respective official gene symbol, Ensembl identifiers 
and associated UniProt IDs, without having to know that Bcl-2 is a gene symbol alias. Moreover, GNG
features miRNA name conversion for 22 different miRBase release versions from 271 different species, and includes
miRNA metadata for the current miRBase version 22.
